## Choose Latex Tools

A few Latex editers can be choosed. One suggestion is Tex Live. 

There are alternatives, for example TinyTex, MikTex. 

For a programmer, I choose VSCode, an IDE for most languages.

## Why using LaTex, instead of Word or other editors

- Latex files are quite similar with Markdown files, written in pure text, matching with a programmer's taste
- A Latex file generates PDF file with full-control (Word is too perfect for me to control its outlooks)
- Having lots of extensions, to draw formulas, diagrams, graphs using pure texts. As a programmer, I can extend it as I like. 
- Writing both codes and docuemnts in one IDE, VSCode
- As a VIM user and a Majaro i3 user, I prefer to use keyboard to do most of things


## Setup Env

I use VSCode, its extension LaTex Workshop, and the extension's dependency Tex Live. My OS is Manjaro i3. 

- Install Tex Live, refer to [Downloading and Installation Guide](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- Ensure `pdflatex` and `latexmk` are working in cmdline
- Install LaTex Workshop in VSCode, refer to [Installation Guide](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install)
- Edit (change words and save) the sample .tex file, [MK Latex Examples.tex](./the-first-example/MK%20Latex%20Examples.tex)
- Open the generated .pdf file, side by side with .tex file, to view the changes
